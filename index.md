This site will be dedicated to creating blog posts for ST 558.

My name is Kelley Breeze and I live in Durham, NC. I completed my undergraduate degree in history and pre-veterinary medicine at NC State. I returned to NC State for graduate school where I earned my MBA as well as my Master of Arts in Teaching (secondary science education). For the past ten years I have taught high school science at a title I school in Durham. Over the years I have taught chemistry, biology, AP environmental science, and Earth science. I am looking forward to learning about GitHub and applied statistics!
