##This is my first blog post.

The role of a data scientist is to act as a sort of bridge between business people/goals within an organization and the engineers. A data scientist can help to translate the needs of the organization from a business perspective into actionable requirements that the engineers can then build. A data scientist should have a solid background in statitics combined with the ability to understand business problems. They can use this to form questions that can be investigated using real world data to drive business decisions. 

What do you think being a data scientist is about?

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
