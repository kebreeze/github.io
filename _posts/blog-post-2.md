# ST 558 Project 1 Blog Post

The purpose of project 1 was to learn to write functions to manipulate and process data sets that all follow the same format and then functions that would automatically plot the returned data based on the class of that dataset. Prior to this project I had essentially no experience creating and writing my own functions. Over the course of completing the project I found that reading and understanding the documentation for various functions within R became much easier, which in turn helped me to think more methodically about how to set up my own functions. Even though it was frustrating at times, it was really helpful to work through issues that did not return the results that I expected, or that refused to run at all. These issues forced me to investigate how different functions and objects work within R and what I was trying to ask them to do in the context of the project.

One thing that I will definitely do differently on future projects is to read through the requirements entirely and then try to rewrite the instructions for each step in my own words, as well as diagramming out the requirements of each function. I think that this will really help me to clarify in my mind what the goal of a certain step/function should be before I begin attempting to write any code for that step. 

There were a few times when working on project 1 when I was focused on trying to get something to work and it would keep failing. In these situations I found it really useful to take a step back and try and diagram out what the instructions were asking, what I wanted to happen, and then the steps that I needed to do to get to the desired result. I found that in many of these cases I was trying to either return a result that the instructions were not asking for or I was not giving the function the right type of data to be able to perform the desired manipulation.

Overall, I am happy with the end result that I was able to produce for project 1. I feel that I gained a much deeper understanding of how functions work and how to create my own functions that will help keep my code much easier to read.
